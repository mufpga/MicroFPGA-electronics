# Electronics

This folder contains the Altium projects, the bill of materials (BOM) and Gerber files necessary to replicate the electronic boards used with the FPGA. Refer to the [electronics guide](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA/blob/master/tutorials/electronics.md) for detailed descriptions.

Both electronic boards were designed by Christian Kieser (Electronic workshop, EMBL).
