# MicroFPGA configuration

[MicroFPGA](https://mufpga.github.io) is an FPGA-based platform for the electronic control of microscopes. It aims at using affordable FPGA to generate or read signals from a variety of devices, including cameras, lasers, servomotors, filter-wheels, etc. It can be controlled via [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/), or its [Java](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-java), [Python](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-py) and [LabView](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-labview) communication libraries, and comes with optional complementary [electronics](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-electronics).

## Content

This repository contains the complementary electronics for [MicroFPGA](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA). The description of the electronics can be found in the [corresponding section](https://mufpga.github.io/resource1_electronics.html) of the homepage.
