## Content

The AOTF conversion board takes two TTL inputs per channels:
1. Enable in: a TTL trigger such as the one generated by MicroFPGA laser triggers or a camera exposure signal.
2. DAQ or PWM: a PWM signal such as the one generated by MicroFPGA PWM signals.

The PWM signal is low-passed and the resulting analog output is multiplied by the TTL signal. The resulting output is a 5 V analog signal that can be synchronized with a camera, and whose level is adjusted by changing the PWM input duty cycle.

We used this board in addition to our electronics box in order to control AOTF/AOM, for instance with DPSS lasers.
